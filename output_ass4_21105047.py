Enter first integer value(dividend): 456
Enter second integer value(divisor): 34

Quotient: 13 
Remainder: 14

a. Check whether the function (divmod()) is callable or not:
True, which means it is callable

b. Check whether all the values are zero or not:
All values in result(i.e. quotient and remainder) are non-zero.

c. Add (4,5,6) to the result and filter out values greater than 4:
Values greater than 4(in list format) are: [5, 6, 13, 14]

d. Convert the above result into a set datatype:
The output of previous part in set datatype would be: {13, 5, 6, 14}

e. Make the set immutable:
The immutable set would be: frozenset({13, 5, 6, 14})

f. Evaluate the maximum value from the set and find out its hash value:
The maximum value from the set is: 14
The hash value of 14(considering it to be integer) is 14 and its hash value is -7452790390366548081(if we consider 14 as a string).
